Time is priceless and if you have some to spare then there is no other better way to help an open source project than to get involved at one level or another. Contributions are appreciated and needed in any of the following ways:

  * Help diagnose and report problems
  * Suggest fixes by sending in patches
  * Improve the code
  * Help with unit and end-to-end testing
  * Publish an article on your blog (send the link) or elsewhere (e.g., community sites) to educate others regarding some aspect of the project
  * Help with missing documentation

**Thank you!**
