If you have any ideas or thoughts, leave a comment.


# Details #

  * Graphical interface. This just MIGHT happen if someone would sit down and do it, personally I don't really have the time but if the demand is big enough, I might set someone else on it. **DONE** Pirni Pro is available in Cydia Store.

  * Packet injector. This will allow you to change the data packets sent over the network. Useful if you want to block access to specific sites, or set up a security system where users need o log in in order to surf.

  * Packet analyzer. This is doable, most likely with a GUI. Think Wireshark lite, for iPhone. Could be really useful for packet analyzing on the go instead of just sniffing. **DELAYED PROJECT**

  * Automatic flag completion. I could fix this if it's needed. ATM pirni asks for IP-adresses to spoof but this could easily be fetched from the OS for greater user experience. **DONE**

  * SSL Poisoning. Ability to change SSL certificates so all data sent over the network will be plain-text after decryption.
